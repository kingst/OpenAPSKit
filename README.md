# OpenAPSKit

This is an iOS / Swift native port of the OpenAPS Javascript library. We'll add more details soon, but if you're interested you can see our [port notes](port_notes.md) to get the latest.

Current status:
- Ported one of eight functions, Profile
- It passes the Javascript unit tests, which we ported to Swift Testing, but that's it so far (still a lot to be done).
